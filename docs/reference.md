# Reference

The `pipelines/utils` folder contains a set of modules used across the
pipelines.

## [Processing](reference/processing.md)

This set of modules define a series of pipeline classes, each encapsulating
access to one of the key data sources.

These are used extensively within the pipeline notebooks to define the specifics
of a given pipeline. The documentation here should explain how these pipelines
operate.

Adding or altering data sources should be based on the patterns defined in these
classes.

## [Utilities](reference/utilities.md)

The `utils` module tree also contains modules (other than the processing modules), which contain commonly used functions.
