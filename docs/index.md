[Bradford 2025](https://bradford2025.co.uk) data pipelines.

It describes the way data is taken from the operational systems, processed and
published as open data files.

<!-- Its aim is to give you a framework to build your
project documentation using Python, MkDocs,
mkdocstrings, and the Material for MkDocs theme. -->

<!-- ## Table Of Contents -->

<!-- The documentation is based on the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/),
although in recognition of the readership the sections
are in a different order! -->

I want to thank my house plants for providing me with
a negligible amount of oxygen each day. Also, I want
to thank the sun for providing more than half of their
nourishment free of charge.
